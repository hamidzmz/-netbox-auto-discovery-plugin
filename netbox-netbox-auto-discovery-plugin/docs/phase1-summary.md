# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 of the NetBox Auto Discovery Plugin is now complete. This phase focused on establishing the data layer foundation with proper models, views, forms, and UI components.

## Completed Components

### 1. Data Models (`models.py`)

Four core models implemented:

#### Scanner
- Supports both Network Range and Cisco Switch scan types
- Stores credentials (SSH, SNMP v2c, SNMP v3)
- Links to NetBox Site for resource association
- Includes automation settings (scan interval)
- Fields:
  - Basic: name, scanner_type, status, description, site
  - Network Range: cidr_range
  - Cisco Switch: target_hostname, connection_protocol
  - SSH: username, password, port
  - SNMP: community, port, v3 credentials
  - Automation: scan_interval_hours

#### ScanRun
- Tracks individual scan executions
- Records timing, status, and metrics
- Stores logs and error messages
- Links to background job via job_id
- Fields:
  - scanner (FK), status, started_at, completed_at
  - Metrics: ips_discovered, devices_discovered, interfaces_discovered, vlans_discovered
  - Logging: log_output, error_message, job_id

#### DiscoveredDevice
- Audit record linking scan runs to NetBox devices
- Tracks whether device was created or updated
- Stores raw discovery data as JSON
- Fields:
  - scan_run (FK), device (FK), action, discovered_data

#### DiscoveredIPAddress
- Audit record linking scan runs to NetBox IP addresses
- Tracks discovered hostname and services
- Stores open ports array and service details
- Fields:
  - scan_run (FK), ip_address (FK), action
  - hostname, open_ports, services

### 2. Choice Sets (`choices.py`)

Implemented using NetBox `ChoiceSet`:
- `ScannerTypeChoices`: network_range, cisco_switch
- `ScannerStatusChoices`: active, disabled
- `ScanRunStatusChoices`: pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled
- `ConnectionProtocolChoices`: ssh, snmp_v2c, snmp_v3

### 3. Views (`views.py`)

Complete CRUD operations for all models:
- **Scanner**: View, List, Edit, Delete, BulkImport, BulkEdit, BulkDelete
- **ScanRun**: View, List, Edit, Delete, BulkDelete
- **DiscoveredDevice**: View, List, Delete, BulkDelete
- **DiscoveredIPAddress**: View, List, Delete, BulkDelete

All views use NetBox generic view classes for consistency.

### 4. Tables (`tables.py`)

Django Tables2 implementations:
- `ScannerTable`: Displays scanners with type badges, status, site, and run count
- `ScanRunTable`: Shows runs with status, timing, and discovery metrics
- `DiscoveredDeviceTable`: Lists discovered devices with actions
- `DiscoveredIPAddressTable`: Lists discovered IPs with hostnames and actions

### 5. Forms (`forms.py`)

Multiple form types per model:
- **ScannerForm**: Full create/edit with fieldsets grouped by scanner type
  - Password inputs for credentials
  - Dynamic field visibility based on scanner type (via fieldset attrs)
- **ScannerFilterForm**: Multi-select filters for type, status, site
- **ScannerBulkEditForm**: Mass update status, site, description
- Similar forms for ScanRun, DiscoveredDevice, DiscoveredIPAddress

### 6. Filtersets (`filtersets.py`)

Django-filter implementations:
- Custom search across multiple fields
- Multi-select filters for statuses and types
- Foreign key filters for relationships
- All connected to list views and API (future)

### 7. URL Configuration (`urls.py`)

RESTful URL patterns:
- `/scanners/`: List and bulk operations
- `/scanners/<pk>/`: Detail, edit, delete, changelog
- `/scan-runs/`: List and bulk operations
- `/scan-runs/<pk>/`: Detail, edit, delete, changelog
- Similar patterns for discovered resources

### 8. Navigation (`navigation.py`)

Comprehensive menu structure:
- **Scanners group**:
  - Scanners list with Add/Import buttons
  - Scan Runs list with View All button
- **Discovery Results group**:
  - Discovered Devices list
  - Discovered IP Addresses list
- Custom icon: `mdi-radar`

### 9. Templates

Created detail page templates:
- `scanner.html`: Shows scanner config with conditional sections based on type
  - Network Range or Cisco Switch configuration panels
  - SSH/SNMP credentials (masked)
  - Recent scan runs table
  - Quick link to full run history
- `scanrun.html`: Displays scan execution details
  - Status, timing, duration
  - Discovery summary metrics
  - Log output with scrollable pre block
  - Error messages (if failed)
  - Links to discovered resources

### 10. Plugin Configuration (`__init__.py`)

Updated metadata:
- Author: Hamid Zamani (hamidzamani445@gmail.com)
- Proper version and description
- Base URL: `auto-discovery`
- Min/max NetBox version constraints
- Default settings for timeouts and concurrency

### 11. Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

Added required libraries:
- `python-nmap>=0.7.1`: Network scanning
- `netmiko>=4.3.0`: SSH device connections
- `pysnmp>=4.4.12`: SNMP operations

Updated author and project URLs.

### 12. Documentation

- Data persistence to NetBox models

### Phase 3: Scan Execution UI
- "Run Scan" button on scanner detail page
- Action view to enqueue scan job
- Real-time status updates
- Scan history tab

### Phase 4: REST API
- `api/serializers.py`, `api/views.py`, `api/urls.py`
- API endpoints for all models
- OpenAPI documentation

### Phase 5: Search & GraphQL
- `search.py` with search indexes
- `graphql.py` with schema definitions

### Phase 6: Testing & Docker
- Virtual switch setup guides
- Docker-compose examples
- Integration tests

### Phase 7: Polish
- Screenshots of working scans
- Architecture diagram
- Video demonstration

## Next Steps

To continue implementation:

1. **Create migrations**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec netbox python manage.py makemigrations netbox_netbox_auto_discovery_plugin
   docker-compose exec netbox python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Create a scanner via UI
   - Verify data saves correctly
   - Check change logging works

3. **Implement Phase 2** (Background Jobs):
   - Create `jobs.py`
   - Implement network range scan logic
   - Implement Cisco switch scan logic
   - Test with mock data

4. **Add scan execution** (Phase 3):
   - Create action view
   - Add "Run Scan" button
   - Wire up job enqueuing

## Testing Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2:

- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] Migrations create all tables
- [ ] Scanner creation works via UI
- [ ] Scanner list displays correctly
- [ ] Scanner detail page renders
- [ ] Filter forms work
- [ ] Bulk operations functional
- [ ] Change logging tracks edits
- [ ] Tags can be assigned
- [ ] Custom fields work (if configured)
- [ ] Navigation menu appears
- [ ] URL routing works

## Known Issues

1. **Lint Errors**: Import errors in IDE are expected (NetBox modules only available at runtime)
2. **Template References**: Old `netbox-auto-discovery.html` template can be removed
3. **Credential Encryption**: Currently plain text; needs integration with NetBox secrets in Phase 2
4. **No Migrations Yet**: Must be generated before plugin can be used

## Conclusion

Phase 1 establishes a solid foundation with:
- Clean data model architecture
- Proper NetBox plugin conventions
- Complete UI scaffolding
- Comprehensive documentation

The plugin is ready for Phase 2 implementation (background jobs and actual scanning logic).
